# This is configuration file for CASSCF calculation
# active space : occ,11; closed,1; 10 active orb, 9 active electron, 1 core.
# basis set : avtz

# name of this calculation
# provide a compact name without complicated characters
# this will be used for names of the directory and in several other places

name : cas-722-1-avtz

# type of calculation being run
# currently supported : multi, mrci
#    multinact and mrcinact will be added in future
#

type : multi

# dependency
# if the calculation depends on other calculation provide its name
# only multi calculations depends on other multi
#    for example:
#        multi-622/2 depends on multi-722/1
#        mrci-622/2  depends on multi-622/2
# note that only one dependency is allowed (and natural so)
# suppose multi-622/2 depends on multi-722/1 and if that is not done
# the manager will refuse to import results or export input jobset

depends : none

# template file
# provide a templated molpro input file which will be used to generate
# exported jobsets. the holes in template will be filled at the time
# of setting up the input files.
#
# NOTE : this file is copied to job managers root directory.
#        the input file generated from this is suggestive in nature.
#        you may choose to modify the input file in any way you wish
#        finally, when the results are imported, the final input file
#        supplied is copied for storage purposes.
#
# the content of this template file is documented elsewhere.
#

template : multi-722-1-avtz.template

# record on which the orbitals are usually available
# this is just a default value used for creating job files when exporting
# it can be changed later in the ".calc" file if orbitals are not on this record

record : 2901.2

# variable names from results file that need to be extracted
# it is our responsibility that these variables are present in that file.

resvars : E1AP E2AP E1APP

# Description of this calculation type and what is being calculated
# Need not be given, but it must be present as empty string

desc : this is a multi calculation with 722/1 active space.
